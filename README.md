### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
#### I am Emerson Pereira

A **Full Stack Developer** from Brazil with a passion for programming. I started with Applesoft BASIC back in 1986 (I just realize how old I am on moments like that!), got a little bit of Turbo Pascal and C at college and as a developer learned JavaScript, TypeScript and Python.

I am trying to get better at both JS and Python, as well as getting in touch with other langagues -- Go and Java are on my radar right now.
