### Hi there 👋

My name is Emerson Pereira, a full stack developer from Brazil with a passion for programming. I started with Applesoft BASIC back in 1986 (I just realize how old I am on mommments like that!) and after learning JavaScrpit/TypeScrip at front, got hooked by Python.

Ok, JavaScript and TypeScript are fine, I am full stack after all and must code with them and though I have a preference for Python, I try to get better at both JS and Python, as well as getting in touch with other langagues -- Go and Java are on my radar right now.
